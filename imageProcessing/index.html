  <h2>Fourier Transformation Examples</h2>
  <p>The Fourier transform is a fundamental tool for understanding signal and image content, modelling, and filter design. On this page you will find a number of simple examples illustrating simple relations between signal and images and their corresponding fourier transform. The examples are made in Matlab R2021b. The Fourier specturm is the function of lengths of the complex elements in the Fourier transform. In Matlab this is calculated using the abs function. Also, in all examples, the fftshift function has been used to reorder the output of the fft function, such that the origin is in the center of the signal or image.</p>

  <h3>Approximating a 1 dimensional (1D) box function with limited frequencies.</h3>

  <p>Here you see an example of a 1D box function and its Fourier spectrum using the fft and fftshift functions in Matlab. In the video, I iteratively remove high-frequency components symmetrically from the left and right.</p>

  <h3>Influence on the width of a 1 dimensional (1D) box function on the Fourier spectrum.</h3>
  <img src="images/boxSize.gif" alt="Frequency approximation of a box function in 1D" class="center">
  <p>The Fourier transform of a box function is a sinc function (sinc(x)=sin(x)/x), and the wavelength is proportional to the width of the box function. The Fourier transform assumes the signal to be periodic and a horizontal translation of the box does not change its Fourier spectrum.</p>
